SkinAI is a sophisticated AI-driven system engineered for the automated analysis of dermatological images to identify various skin conditions. This technology aims to expedite and refine the diagnosis of skin diseases, offering support to dermatologists and improving the availability of top-tier dermatological care.

Programming Environment: Python
Key Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
Functionality: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of skin diseases.
Input: A labeled dataset of skin images.
Output: Evaluation of model accuracy, confusion matrix, detailed classification report, visualizations of accuracy and loss, and examples of image predictions.

Operational Breakdown of the Script:

Model Loading: Initiates by importing a pre-trained model with optimal weights derived from validation data.

Model Evaluation: Assesses the model using a test dataset to calculate loss and accuracy, which are then outputted to the console.

Predictions: Generates predictions for the test dataset, classifying each image into the most likely disease category.

True Labels Preparation: Constructs a vector of actual labels from the test dataset for comparison.

Training History Visualization: Charts depicting training and validation accuracy and loss over time are displayed to visualize the model's learning progression.

Confusion Matrix: Generates and displays a confusion matrix to visually represent how well the model distinguishes between different diseases.

Classification Report: Produces a report detailing precision, recall, and F1 scores for each disease category, reflecting the model’s classification accuracy.

Sample Predictions Display: Presents a selection of five test images alongside their true and predicted labels to showcase the model’s diagnostic accuracy.
